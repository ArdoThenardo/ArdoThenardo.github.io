Gran Turismo series featuring many iconic race tracks from fictional circuit such as Trial Mountain and Grand Valley, as well as real-life circuit like Laguna Seca. GT-Road was created as my way to appreciate those well-crafted race tracks.</p><p>GT-Road website was created with ASP.NET Core framework and its interface was built using Blazor. Because of that, I using C# language to write major logic and functions for the website. HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript (thanks to JS interoperability in Blazor) were also used to construct the view for all pages because Blazor allow me to utilize those languages for building the UI.</p><p>In order to provide race track information for the visitor, GT-Road is fetching data from an API (gtskyline.gt-road.net). That API were written by me, also using ASP.NET Core framework. This “gtskyline” API is using MongoDB library as its database system and all data were stored in MongoDB Atlas cloud service.</p><p>NOTE:<br>- Device Mockup created from <a href=\"https://deviceframes.com/templates/macbook-air\">MacBook Air mockups</a>, <a href=\"https://deviceframes.com/templates/iphone-13\">iPhone mockups</a>, <a href=\"https://deviceframes.com/templates/ipad-mini-6\">iPad Mini mockups</a></p>",

The purpose of this implementation is to learn how to construct user interface for iOS platform with SwiftUI.</p><p>When I was translating Nola's design into iOS app, I took several liberties from her design such as add navigation bar with back button and share button.
